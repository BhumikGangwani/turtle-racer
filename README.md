# Turtle Racer
The exciting game of horse flat racing, except the horses are turtles.


## Setup
Clone this repository to a local directory. Refer to [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for more guidance.

Next, you should install the neccessary packages to run main.py: *turtle, random,* and *time*. You can install these using **pip**:
```
- pip install turtle
```
```
- pip install random
```
```
- pip install time
```

Now your setup is completed!

## Running the Code
To run the code, run **main.py**. This will open up a Turtle window and layout the race components on the window.

![Layout Window](https://github.com/BhumikGangwani/turtle-racer/blob/master/layout.png)

A dialog box should pop up where you can enter the number of people betting on the race.

After that, another dialog box will pop up where you should enter the name of the better and the color of the turtle they want to bet on. The entry should be in the format: **Name, Color**

You will have to do this for the number of players that you entered in the previous step.

**You're finally ready to enjoy Turtle flat racing!**
